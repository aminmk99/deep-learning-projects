# Adaptive Learning Algorithms

Machine learning models often assume that training and test data follow the same distribution. However, in real-world scenarios, data distributions often change over time, leading to **distribution shift**. Adaptive learning algorithms help models adjust to these changes and maintain high accuracy.

## 🔹 1. Online Learning Algorithms 📡
- Update the model **incrementally** as new data arrives.
- No need to retrain from scratch!
- Common in **stock market predictions**, **fraud detection**, and **personalized recommendations**.

### **Example Algorithms:**
- **Perceptron Algorithm** – A simple online learning method.
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** – Updates model parameters after each new data point.

---

## 🔹 2. Domain Adaptation Algorithms 🌍
- Handle cases where the **training and test data come from different distributions** but are still related.
- The model learns **transferable features** to work well across different domains.

### **Examples:**
- A **speech recognition model** trained on **American English** but deployed in **British English**.
- A **self-driving car** trained in **California** but deployed in **New York**.

---

## 🔹 3. Transfer Learning 🔄
- Uses knowledge from **one task** to improve performance on **a different but related task**.
- Common in **deep learning** (e.g., pretrained models like BERT or ResNet).

### **Examples:**
- A model trained on **millions of images** for general object detection → Fine-tuned for **medical X-ray analysis**.
- A **language model** trained on Wikipedia → Fine-tuned for **sentiment analysis**.

---

## 🔹 4. Concept Drift Detection & Adaptation 📈📉
- Detects when the **relationship between inputs and outputs changes over time**.
- Often used in **dynamic environments** like finance and cybersecurity.

### **Examples:**
- A **fraud detection system** must adapt as fraud patterns evolve.
- **Customer preferences change** over time, requiring AI recommendation systems to adjust.
